# SLACK EMBLEM

SlackEmblem is just a lightweight clone of the ever-popular web chat app for professionals [Slack](https://www.slack.com). Only difference is it's for professional knights, magicians, and royalties from [Nintendo](https://www.nintendo.com)'s popular tactical RPG video game series, [Fire Emblem](https://fireemblem.nintendo.com).

## Why this App

The app was built for the fun purpose of demonstrating the power of front end and back end functionalities, utilizing JavaScript and ReactJS to showcase the presentation of a responsive website, and Firebase to manage chat message and users content within a realtime database in JSON format.

Anyone can log in using Google 3rd Party Authentication and post their messages there in realtime and connect with each other... including the professional knights, magicians, and royalties from the Fire Emblem games.

#### Disclaimer: 
The professional knights, magicians, and royalties from the Fire Emblem game series may, or may not respond to your messages while using the chat. But please do invite your friend to take advantage of this application and take over their world.
